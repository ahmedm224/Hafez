- Serverless transcription via Netlify Functions
- Real-time feedback on recitation accuracy
- Arabic-specific text normalization for better matching

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hafez.git
cd hafez/hafez-pwa
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the app.

## Deployment on Netlify

### Automatic Deployment
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Set the build command: `npm run build`
4. Set the publish directory: `dist`
5. Add environment variable: `FIREWORKS_AI_KEY` with your Fireworks AI API key

### Manual Deployment

## How Voice Recognition Works

1. **Audio Recording**: The app captures high-quality audio using the Web Audio API
2. **Serverless Processing**: Audio is sent to a Netlify function (`/netlify/functions/transcribe`)
3. **AI Transcription**: The function uses Fireworks AI's Whisper v3 Turbo for Arabic speech-to-text
4. **Text Matching**: Transcribed text is compared against the Quran using Arabic-specific normalization
5. **Feedback**: Users receive real-time accuracy scores and progress tracking

## API Integration

The voice recognition is powered by Fireworks AI's Whisper v3 Turbo model, which provides:
- Superior Arabic language support
- Fast transcription (turbo model)
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for better audio processing
- High accuracy for religious text recitation
